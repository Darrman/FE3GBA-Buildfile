The [ToggleRed]Tower of Valni[ToggleRed] has appeared to the
east of Castle Frelia on the world map.[.][A]
Once held by Grado's troops, it has become
home to a host of [ToggleRed]dark creatures[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Battling these monstrosities is a good [.]
way for units to gain strength.[.][A]
Try using the tower as a training area [.]
to gain extra experience.[.][A][0x02]
Be aware: you cannot save your battle 
preparations for tower skirmishes.[A]
Once you clear a tower map, you'll have 
access to the next floor.[.][A]
Each floor is more difficult than the last, 
so come prepared![.][A][0x02]
Dark creatures also may appear on other 
bases on the world map.[.][A]
To engage these demons in combat,[.][A]
simply place the cursor on their location 
and press the A Button.[.][A][0x02]
If the battle goes poorly and you're in 
danger of losing units,[.][A]
use the [ToggleRed]retreat[.][ToggleRed] command on the map 
menu to withdraw your troops.[.][A][X]
