FIRE EMBLEM - MYSTERY OF THE EMBLEM[N]
GAME BOY ADVANCE EDITON, FEE3 BUILD[AN]
Welcome to the game. Currently,[N]
things are very much a work in[AN]
progress, but there should hopefully[N]
be a public release sooner or later.[AN]
All maps and almost all portraits are[N]
in quite a rough state, and all units[AN]
currently have 100% resistance to avoid[N]
crashing the game with blank levels.[AN]
Most of this project was made by[N]
Darrman, with the actual functional[AN]
portraits made by Alusq a long time[N]
ago. ASM hacks were made by Teq and[AN]
Circles for their respective stuff,[N]
while the current dismount version[AN]
was made by Colorz. All names are[N]
at their FE3 fan translation level,[AN]
even the basic stuff like Heal.[N]
The author strongly dislikes some[AN]
localised character names, like[N]
Caeda and whatnot, but everything[AN]
has been reverted because of somebody[N]
who resides on a certain discord.[AN]
You know who you are. Regardless,[N]
sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.[AN]
Gameplay is functional through[N]
Chapter 5 out of 22.[A][X]
