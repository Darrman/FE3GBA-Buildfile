The deceased King Grunia had two children:[N]
Princess Yumina and Prince Yubello,[AN]
twins of 13 to 14 years of age.[N]
The King was scared of Garnef, so he sent[AN]
the two to Khadein. I heard they were[N]
held as hostages and locked inside[AN]
a dark room. When they were finally[N]
rescued by Wendel, they were on the[AN]
brink of death. The bishop immediately[N] 
took them to a monastery in Khadein[AN]
to care for them.[A][X]
