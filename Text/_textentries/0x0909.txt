You two are Grunia's...[N]
Prince Yubello and Princess Yumina!?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Waa... Lawrence... He's dead.[N]
What should we do?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
You fiends!! Don't come near us![N]
Otherwise, we'll kill ourselves!![A][N]
[OpenRight]
No! You've got it wrong...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x36][0x01]
Ah... Lord Marth.[N]
You finally caught the rebels?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
General Lang! Wait![N]
Those children are innocent.[A][N]
Can you hand them to us?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
That isn't possible. Prisoners[N]
of war must be taken to my castle.[A][N]
I must also execute them as soon as[N]
possible, so that other people dare not[A][N]
defy us. Now, your highness.[N]
You must head immediately to Macedonia.[A][N]
The Macedonian army has rebelled,[N]
and its princess appears to have been[A][N]
captured by them. Emperor Hardin has[N]
ordered that you go and[A][N]
rescue Princess Minerva.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
What? Macedonia? I understand, General.[N]
If it's to rescue Princess Minerva,[A][N]
I will gladly go. But please hand those[N]
children to me. I beg of you, General Lang![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Don't be stubborn, your highness![N]
When I said no, I meant it.[A][N]
Well, you two, come over here![A][N]
[OpenLeft]
No, let go of me![N]
Yubello, help me![A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]
Yumina... Yumina...[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Wait, wait!![N]
Lang! Release those children![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x0B][0x01]

Your highness, please calm down![N]
If we fight with Lang now, we[AN]
will become traitors. On top of that,[N]
we currently don't have the[AN]
strength to oppose Lang's army.[AN]
[OpenRight]
But, Jeigan, can we really give[N]
those children to Lang? That I...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Right now... No matter what, we must stay[N]
calm! If we go to Macedonia...[AN]
And successfully rescue Princess Minerva,[N]
Macedonia may be able to help us.[AN]
Your highness, please stay calm for now.[N]
We must first go to Macedonia![A][X]
