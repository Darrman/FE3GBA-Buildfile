Yumina, Yubello. This place is the[N]
territory of the dreaded Macedonian Vikings.[AN]
Originally, I didn't want to come here,[N]
but we must cross through here[AN]
to reach the bishop.[AN]
[FR]
Oguma, I'm scared...[N]
I want to... go back...[AN]
[Right]
Yubello! Be strong, you're a man!![N]
Remember, you can use fire magic[AN]
to attack with![AN]
[FR]
But Mister Wendel told me not to use[N]
it to fight with... Not that[AN]
I like to fight anyway...[AN]
[Right]
Honestly, you're still making excuses?[N]
Right now it's just the two of us.[AN]
If you don't become strong, I...[N]
I don't know what to do...[AN]
[FR]
Oh... Yumina...[N]
I will try my best...[AN]
So please don't cry.[AN]
[ML]
Crap... This is bad...[N]
We've been discovered.[AN]
No choice, we'll have to break[N]
through them. You two,[AN]
stay close to me![A]
