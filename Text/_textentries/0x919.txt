Ryuke, a coward like you wouldn't dare[N]

I don't care about this country anymore.[AN]
You can do what you want with it.[N]

dealt with "that guy" personally.[AN]

She cannot be saved...[AN]

Don't waste my time.[N]
Hand her over now, or do you[AN]
prefer to die by my lance?[AN]

O-okay! I understand.[N]
Hey, you, bring the princess here![AN]
