After five long years, the great war[N]
with the Durhua Empire, which caused[N]
much suffering and known as the War of[AN]
Darkness, ended with the defeat of[N]
Earth Dragon King Mediuth.[N]
The warriors who had gathered under[AN]
the Fire Emblem returned to their[N]
homelands, and to restore the lands[N]
from devastation, used up much[AN]
strength. Among the countries that[N]
once made up the seven Kingdoms of[N]
Akaneia, Gra and Grunia were ruined.[AN]
Aritia, Orleans, Macedonia and Talis[N]
were also deeply scarred.[N]
Even the grand Kingdom of Akaneia[AN]
was undergoing restoration.[N]
Then, at the royal capital Pales,[N]
which was still shaken by the war,[AN]
an important event occurred[AN]
with King Orleans's younger[N]
brother, Hardin's marriage to[AN]
Princess Nina and his ascension[N]
as the 24th King of Akaneia.[AN]
After becoming king, Hardin,[N]
although seemingly reluctant,[AN]
instantly restored the country.[N]
He gathered many soldiers[AN]
to create a powerful army.[N]
Following that, he announced[AN]
the restoration of the Holy Empire[N]
of Akaneia, and declared himself Emperor.[AN]
One year after the end of the war[N]
with Durhua, the world seems to [AN]
be entering a state of peace.[N]
But the wheels of fate...[AN]
appear to have a fault.[X]
