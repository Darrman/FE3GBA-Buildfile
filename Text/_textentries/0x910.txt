Lord Marth!! Great, so you are here.[A]
[MR]
Katua!? I heard a rebellion broke[N]
out in Macedonia. Are you alright?[A]
[ML]
Yes. My sister, Paola, and I managed[N]
to escape, but Minerva was captured[AN]
by the rebels... Marth, please rescue[N]
Minerva! If this continues,[AN]
her life will be in danger![a]
[MR]
Of course I will. Katua, please[N]
take me to where the princess is.[a]
[ML]
Yes! But we must break through the[N]
bordering forests in front of us...[AN]
These forests are full of General[N]
Ryuke's dragon knights.[AN]
If we approach head on, we'll[N]
be discovered by them.[a]
[MR]
Is that so...? Then we will march[N]
through the left or right side.[AN]
I understand. Katua, leave[N]
everything to us![A][X]
