After liberating Grunia, Marth accepted
Wendel's request to find the lost[A]
Orbs, and headed to Raman Temple.
However the ancient temple, built to[A]
worship Narga, was wrecked by constant
warring and has now become a thieves' hideout.[A]
"They're escaping with the temple's 
valuable treasures. We mustn't let them[A]
take them away. We must recover them!!"
"We mustn't attract the attention of the[A]
soldiers guarding Cashmere Bridge.
We don't stand a chance of winning,[A]
so don't approach at all costs."
"Also it seems there's a travelling child[A]
dancer who's lost her way in the
forests. We must rescue her before she[A]
gets ambushed by the thieves!"
After the troops received their orders,[A]
they surrounded Raman Temple.
The flame of a new battle was about to ignite.[A][X]
