Commander Lang.[N]
A-Aritia's army has come...[A]
[ML]
Get a grip, you fool. Their[N]
army doesn't amount to anything.[AN]
They can't possibly defeat us.[A]
[MR]
But Lord George's archers left[N]
to quell the rebellion.[AN]
Can we win just by ourselves?[AN]
[ML]
What did you say!? Call George[N]
back this instant. While you're[AN]
there, call that mercenary,[N]
Navarre, here. Anyway, I'll[AN]
leave this to you, General Toras.[N]
I must leave to prepare the[AN]
defences inside. You will stay[N]
here and guard to the death.[AN]
You mustn't let them get close.[N]
Understood?[A][X]
