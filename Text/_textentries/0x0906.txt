Oh... Please spare this girl.[N]
She is just 10 years old.[A][N]
She hasn't even finished[N]
her training as a sister.[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01]
Don't worry, old lady.[N]
We're not going to take this child.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Huh...? Aren't you a[N]
soldier of the Empire?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
No... You've got the wrong idea.[N]
We haven't come here to fight.[A][N]
If you require anything, please ask.[N]
We can give you some food if you want...[A][N]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x0C][0x01]
Wait...[N]
Please, take me with you...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
You...[N]
You're REALLY only 10 years old?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Actually I have already become of age...[N]
But, my grandmother lied for me so[A][N]
the soldiers wouldn't take me away.[N]
Well, I know if I stay here I will [A][N]
eventually be discovered and captured by[N]
the imperial soldiers.[A][N]
Lang's soldiers are like beasts.[N]
But, you're different.[A][N]
You have very kind eyes.[N]
Please, take me out of this place[A][N]
and bring me to your own country.[N]
Is that alright, grandmother?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ah, of course. You will be much safer[N]
compared to here. Young lad, I beg of you.[A][N]
Please protect this girl. If you want, it would[N]
be no problem for her to become your bride.[A][N]
This child, like myself once, is a beautiful girl.[N]
She will definitely make a fine wife.[A][N]
Malliesia, if this youth was to be your[N]
husband, you would be happy, right?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Honestly, grandmother. It's far too early.[N]
I don't know what to do.[A]
