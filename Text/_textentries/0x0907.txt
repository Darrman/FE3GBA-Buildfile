It seems the Empire's reinforcements[N]
have come. It's already reached this[AN]
stage... Lord Oguma, I am deeply sorry[N]
for getting you involved in all of this.[AN]
But, could you listen to one[N]
last request of mine?[A][N]

[OpenRight]
I was sent here by King Talis to[N]
help you. If there is anything I[AN]
can do for you, please ask.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Is that so...? Then, I ask of you...[N]
Please send these children to Macedonia.[AN]
These children... Prince Yubello[N]
and Princess Yumina are the[AN]
children of the late King Grunia.[N]
I have always been protecting them[AN]
in secret, but that is no longer possible.[N]
If they fell into General Lang's hands,[AN]
I bet he would execute them without[N]
question. Please, take these children[AN]
to Wendel at Macedonia.[AN]

[OpenRight]
I understand...[N]
I will protect these two with my life.[A][N]

[OpenLeft]
Truly? Thank you...[N]
Well, Prince Yubello, Princess Yumina,[A][N]
you will escape with Lord Oguma.[A][N]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][Yumina]
No! I won't go. If we must escape,[N]
Lawrence must come with us too.[A][N]

[OpenLeft]
Princess Yumina...[N]
I am afraid I cannot leave.[A][N]
My body is in such agony that [N]
even walking pains me.[A][N]
So, please don't worry about me.[N]
You two must flee.[A][N]

[OpenFarLeft]
Why... Why must you say that...?[N]
Lawrence, you fought to protect us.[A][N]
That's why you suffered such a heavy wound.[N]
How can you tell us to leave you!?[A][N]
I will not go.[N]
I will not leave your side!![A][N]

[OpenRight]
What should we do, General?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Hmm... This is troublesome.[N]
Yumina will undoubtedly stick to her word...[A][N]
I apologise, Lord Oguma. You may leave.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I understand...[N]
Then, I will find another way to help you.[A][N]
I will find Lang and kill him...[N]
I will use my blade to send him to his grave.[A][N]
If I succeed, perhaps the nearby[N]
enemies will retreat.[A][N]
General Lawrence, you must live to see[N]
that day. ...Don't get yourself killed!![A][X]
