Captain George. The commander[N]
ordered us to return to[AN]
the castle immediately.[A]
[MR]
Lang...? I hate that guy. He[N]
treats the civilians like slaves.[AN]
I'm not seriously going to work[N]
for a guy like him.[AN]
Just ignore his order.[A]
[ML]
But, Captain George. If we do that,[N]
you will become a criminal.[AN]
Captain!? Are you thinking[N]
of siding with Aritia...?[AN]
[MR]
No, I couldn't do that... If I did[N]
that right now, my men would get[AN]
into trouble. That's something that[N]
I must avoid at all costs.[A]
[ML]
Captain George...[A]
[MR]
Alright, just tell everyone this.[N]
Tell them to stay where they are.[AN]
However if the enemy gets close,[N]
begin to attack.[A][X]
