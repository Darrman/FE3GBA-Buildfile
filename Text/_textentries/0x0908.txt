Lord Marth! It's you...[N]
Although I knew the enemy's[A][N]
reinforcements had come, but[N]
I didn't expect it was you...[A][N]
It is a shame, that we must fight Aritia...[N]
And fight against your highness...[A][N]

[OpenRight]
Please wait.[N]
I don't intend to fight with you.[A][N]
From the citizens I have discovered[N]
disturbing facts about the atrocities[A][N]
performed by the occupation army.[N]
I will inform Emperor Hardin about[A][N]
these facts. If I meet him, I will[N]
definitely be able to rescue Grunia.[A][N]
So please, put away your weapon.[A][N]

[OpenLeft]
Your highness... I appreciate[N]
your favour. But that is impossible.[A][N]
Your highness, you don't know a thing.[N]
You think that somebody like Hardin would[A][N]
send a heartless man like Lang here for[N]
no reason? He wanted to provoke us into[A][N]
rebelling, so that the Kingdom of Grunia[N]
would be completely destroyed and become[A][N]
ruled by the Empire. That is the reason[N]
why he sent such a cold-blooded man here.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
What? Why would he!? I cannot possibly[N]
believe that Hardin would do such a thing.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
I didn't expect you to accept the[N]
truth so quickly. However, since he[AN]
became Emperor he has completely changed.[N]
He is no longer the Hardin that your[AN]
highness once knew. Anyway, I believe we're[N]
finished here... However, your highness,[AN]
I have just one last request. In this[N]
fortress, Grunia's royal princess and[AN]
prince are hiding. Please save those children.[N]
If you can promise me that,[AN]
I will have no regrets.[N]
Lord Marth... Let's just say that in[AN]
exchange for my life, these children...[N]
I will hand them over to you...[A]

How could you...[A]
