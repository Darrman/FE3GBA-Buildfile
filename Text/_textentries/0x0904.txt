So you are Lord Marth.[N]
Currently the situation is relaxed.[A][N]
We have already subdued most of the rebels.[N]
All that remains is this fortress.[A][N]
Since you are here, I will leave the job[N]
of defeating the rebels' leader,[A][N]
General Lawrence, to you.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Huh!? The leader of the rebels...[N]
is General Lawrence!?[A][N]
Why would he rebel...?[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh... I don't know why. But it[N]
is a fact that he is hiding Grunia's[A][N]
prince. He's probably dreaming of[N]
restoring the Kingdom of Grunia.[A][N]
What a fool. He really thought his[N]
rebellion would be victorious?[A][N]
Lord Marth, you will kill Lawrence and bring[N]
back the hidden Grunian royal children.[A][N]
We will leave this place to you,[N]
and pursue the escaping rebels.[A][N]
We must show those Grunian fools[N]
the consequences of opposing us.[A][N]

[OpenRight]
General Lang...[N]
What are you planning to do!?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
If you want to know, I am going to[N]
slaughter the families of the rebels.[A][N]
Then we will burn down any villages[N]
that harboured the rebels.[A][N]
That will stop them from contemplating[N]
rebellion again. Hahaha![A][N]
I can almost see the tears[N]
on the faces of those fools.[A][N]

[OpenRight]
What?![N]
How can you be so cruel...[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Th-there's nothing wrong![N]
You'd best follow my orders and[A][N]
not think about things too much.[N]
Or do you also intend to[A][N]
rebel against Akaneia!?[A][N]

[OpenRight]
What! Of course not...[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Then you'd better listen to my orders!![N]
Lord Marth, don't think too highly[A][N]
of yourself. In my eyes you are just[N]
the prince of a weak country.[A][N]
With its power, Akaneia can destroy[N]
Aritia at any time. Don't forget this![A][N]
