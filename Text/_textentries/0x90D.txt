I heard General Lawrence resided at[N]
Talis island in his youth.[AN]
At that time, Talis was not unified,[N]
and there were conflicts between the[AN]
island tribes. The general helped a[N]
youthful chief to unite the island.[AN]
From that day on, the general and[N]
the chief, now the current King Talis,[AN] 
have always been in contact.[A][X]
