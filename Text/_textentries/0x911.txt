Warren!? Even you've joined the rebels...?[A]
[ML]
White knight Katua, it's been a long time.[AN]
I am just a hunter. I'll do anything[n]
as long as I get paid.[A]
[MR]
Warren, listen to me![n]
Princess Minerva worked hard to create[AN]
a country where everybody can live and[n]
work in peace. That was the reason[AN]
why she removed those worthless[n]
generals and soldiers. But, even knowing[AN]
this, General Ryuke provoked the soldiers[n]
into joining the coup. His only reason[AN]
being because he wanted to take this[n]
country for himself. So do you think[AN]
what he's doing is right?[A]
[ML]
...Is that true?[N]
I don't like the army doing as they please.[AN]
I understand. If you're going to rescue[n]
the princess, let me help as well.[A][X]
