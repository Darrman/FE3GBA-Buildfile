[MR]
Your highness, it's been a long time.[N]
It's me, Julian.[AN]
[ML]
Julian!? Even though I heard you went to[N]
Macedonia with Rena, I didn't expect to see[AN]
you here... Is Rena well?[N]
Of course, since she is with you.[AN]
[MR]
Well...[N]
Miss Rena suddenly disappeared...[AN]
I... What should I do?[AN]
[ML]
Huh?[N]
Wait, Julian, what happened?[AN]
[MR]
Miss Rena vanished yesterday.[N]
I heard from the villagers that a nasty-[AN]
looking bishop came by.[N]
It seems Miss Rena was taken by him.[AN]
[ML]
A bishop...?[N]
Julian! I heard Princess Maria has also[AN]
gone missing. I have a bad feeling about[N]
all of this. Anyway, staying here won't[AN]
achieve anything. You should come with us.[N]
I am also worried about Rena.[AN]
We can help you look for her.[AN]
[MR]
Your highness...[N]
Thank you.[AN][X]
