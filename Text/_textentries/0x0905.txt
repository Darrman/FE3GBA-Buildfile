...Jeigan, what's going on?[N]
Why has Hardin handed over[A][N]
this country to such a man...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
General Lang was once a noble of Akaneia.[N]
However, in the previous war, he supported[A][N]
the Durhua Empire. I heard that he stole from[N]
other people to add to his own wealth.[A][N]
I fear he has continued his ways in Grunia,[N]
and has caused suffering for its people.[A][N]
So General Lawrence's rebellion[N]
is completely understandable.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Jeigan! How can you say things so casually?[N]
If we don't inform Hardin of the truth,[A][N]
more innocent people will be killed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Your highness, I understand your feelings.[N]
However, Lawrence's rebellion is a fact.[A][N]
First, we must see how we can help him.[N]
Basically we should listen to what the[A][N]
citizens have to say, so we can affirm[N]
what has happened to this country.[A][N]
Then you can talk to General[N]
Lawrence personally.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But the rebels don't know that we're from[N]
Aritia. Can we reach the fortress safely?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Don't worry. Most of the rebels[N]
have already fled.[A][N]
All that remains is Lawrence,[N]
and the children in the fortress.[A][N]
Blocking our path are only bandits,[N]
who have taken advantage of the confusion[N]
so they can raid the villages.[A][N]
They are no problem for us.[N]
You can order Alan to defeat them[N]
in one blow if you want.[A][N]
However, your highness, we have some[N]
fresh recruits in our army that could use[A][N]
some fighting experience. To them, bandits[N]
are relatively strong foes. So be[A][N]
careful not to push them too much.[N]
If possible, I would have liked to [A][N]
fight as well, but my body is not what[N]
it used to be. I will stay by your[A][N]
highness's side, as your tactician.[N]
Well, your highness, we should go![A][X]
