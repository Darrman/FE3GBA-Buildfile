Marth!![AN]
[Right]
Sheeda!?[N]
What, even you've come here...?[AN]
Could it be that something's[N]
happened to Aritia?[AN]
[ML]
Marth... Aritia...[N]
Aritia was ambushed by the imperial army...[AN]
After being ambushed by the Akaneia, Gra[N]
and Orleans united army, the Aritian[AN]
knights were decimated...[N]
Even the castle has fallen...[AN]
[Right]
Wh-what!? How could... Aritia...[N]
Jeigan, what's going on?[AN]
[FR]
It is regrettable... What I feared the[N]
most has happened. Emperor Hardin has[AN]
listened to Lang's words and declared us[N]
traitors. Your highness, please forgive me.[AN]
It is because of me that this has happened.[AN]
[Right]
No, I still cannot believe it.[N]
That Hardin would attack our country.[AN]
Did Hardin really believe Lang, and thought [N]
that we wished to rebel against him?[AN]
[FR]
No, even if that was the case, everything[N]
happened too fast. If they hadn't prepared[AN]
in advance, they wouldn't have been able[N]
to attack us that quickly. I fear...[AN]
The Grunia expedition was a trap they[N]
planned for us all along, as well as the[AN]
rebellion in Macedonia... They wanted us[N]
to leave Aritia, to divide our army's[AN]
strength. Hardin had already decided[N]
upon this action from the beginning.[AN]
What happened with Lang was just an[N]
excuse to attack our country.[AN]
[Right]
No, that can't be right![N]
So you're saying Hardin attacked[AN]
our country for no reason?[N]
And everything was a trap[AN]
that he set up for us?[N]
I don't believe it.[AN]
I don't believe that[N]
Hardin would do that...[AN]
[FR]
Your highness, regardless, our country has[N]
been attacked by Akaneia. Not only that,[AN]
but we were ambushed without prior warning.[N]
To us knights, that is the most dishonourable[AN]
action one could take. In that case, we have[N]
no choice but to fight back with[AN]
our full strength.[AN]
[Right]
Damn, Hardin... Why...[N]
Why did you...[AN]
[FR]
Your highness... Sheeda, what[N]
about the others? Is Ellis safe?[AN]
[ML]
Ellis... She agreed to be their[N]
hostage, to allow me to escape...[AN]
The others... I don't know...[N]
Abel and Est were still fighting[AN]
the last time I saw them...[N]
Marth... I'm sorry.[AN]
Only I escaped, but I had to[N]
so I could warn you... So...[AN]
[Right]
Sheeda... Don't cry.[N]
I understand.[AN]
It's great that you're safe at least.[N]
I should be the one apologising.[AN]
It was because of me that you[N]
experienced such terrible events...[AN]
I will reclaim Aritia. Even if I[N]
must fight Hardin to take it back!![A]
