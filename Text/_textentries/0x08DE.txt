At one time, the Macedonia region[N]
was ruled by the Durhua Empire.[AN]
100 years ago the whole continent was[N]
controlled by the dragon tribe, who sent[AN]
numerous slaves to these undeveloped[N]
forests. The slaves were forced to[AN]
excavate ruins and construct the[N]
country. Many people could not find food,[AN]
were forced to work, and died from abuse.[N]
Amongst such tragic conditions,[AN]
finally one youth stood up. His name was[N]
Iote. He and his companions escaped[AN]
from the forests and fought, riding[N] dragons, to continue the battle of[AN]
liberation. After Durhua's fall, the slaves[N]
established their own country at these rich[AN]
and newly developed lands.[N]
And the heroic Iote was encouraged to[AN]
become its first king.[N]
Afterwards the Kingdom of Macedonia was[AN]
feared as the land of dragon knights,[N]
and that was how it was born.[AN]
However, this strong country not only lost[N]
its Prince Misheil, said to be the[AN]
second coming of Iote.[N]
But now, even the "Red Dragon Knight",[AN]
Princess Minerva, has been lost.[A]
