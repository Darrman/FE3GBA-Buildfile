[FarLeft][Load][Jeigan]
[Left][Load][Marth]
Jeigan, how is the situation at the castle?[N]
Have they found Minerva yet?[AN]
[FL]
Right, about that...[AN]
Although the enemy has fled, there seems[N]
to be no trace of the princess.[AN]
[Left]
Huh, why is that?[N]
Minerva should have been taken here...[AN]
[FL]
Ah... Your highness, General Lang[N]
appears to have arrived.[AN]
I wonder what kind of nonsensical request[N]
he's going to give us this time.[AN]

[MidRight][Load][Lang]
Ah, I should have expected no[N]
less from you, Lord Marth.[AN]
Very impressive. Good work.[N]
Leave Macedonia to me.[AN]
Your highness, you have a new mission.[AN]
[Left]
General Lang, what is it this time?[AN]
[MR]
...Well...[N]
My castle was attacked, and the[AN]
captured Grunian royal children[N]
appear to have been taken.[AN]
The culprit seems to have escaped to[N]
Macedonia. Your highness, you will[AN]
chase after them and bring back[N]
the royal children![AN]
[Left]
What!?[N]
Really, those children...[N]
They're safe... That's great.[AN]
General Lang, I will not[N]
follow your orders.[AN]
We're going back to our own country.[AN]
[MR]
What did you say!?[N]
You're going to disobey my orders?[AN]
So you were behind it, I knew it.[AN]
[Left]
What? What do you mean?[AN]
[MR]
The one who escaped with the royal children[N]
was Oguma, the Talis mercenary.[AN]
He once served under your highness, correct?[N]
It was you who ordered Oguma to escape[AN]
with those two![AN]
[Left]
I don't know a thing.[N]
But if I could, I would have done just that.[AN]
Since that time, when I couldn't rescue[N]
the two, I have been deeply regretful.[AN]
Even if I must fight you,[N]
I will still rescue them.[AN]
[MR]
What, you![N]
Your actions are treasonous![AN]
Do you want me to inform[N]
Emperor Hardin about this!?[AN]
[Left]
Go ahead.[N]
We're planning on going to Pales anyway.[N]
We will inform Hardin and Nina of[AN]
the truth, and of your crimes.[N]
Jeigan, I'm sorry, but I can no[AN]
longer stay silent.[N]
I want to find Oguma, so we[AN]
can rescue those children.[AN]
[FL]
I understand.[N]
You've had to stay patient for so long.[AN]
I have also already reached my limits.[N]
Lang, you have constantly mocked our[AN]
prince of Aritia with your actions.[N]
Even if his highness could forgive you, I[AN]
certainly could not.[N]
Come, draw your sword.[AN]
Even though I, Jeigan, am old,[N]
I will not lose to somebody like you.[AN]
[MR]
Wh-what...![AN]
Damn you... I will not forgive you for this!![AN]
I will inform the Emperor, and turn Aritia[AN]
into dust! Mark my words![AN]
[ClearFace]

[FL]
Ha... He fled fast despite his big words.[N]
He should be pretty far away by now.[AN]
[Left]
Jeigan... You really surprised me.[N]
I couldn't believe you would say[AN]
something like that.[AN]
[FL]
You think I'm too old?[N]
Haha... Your highness, I won't lose to[AN]
you youths just yet.[N]
That said. Even I, who persuaded your[AN]
highness to stay calm, got into a[N]
dispute with Lang.[AN]
I was too careless.[N]
What should we do next?[AN]
[Left]
Hmm. Well, we should go and find Oguma.[N]
If Lang was correct, he should have[AN]
come to Macedonia. I bet he's probably[N]
heading for the village of Wendel's[AN]
residence. Even though I'm worried about[N]
Minerva, there's nothing we can do right now.[AN]
We should go and meet Wendel as well.[AN]
[FL]
Understood.[N]
But, I wonder about Lang...[AN]
I hope nothing bad will happen...[AN][X]
