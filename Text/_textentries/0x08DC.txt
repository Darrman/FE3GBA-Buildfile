Carrying regretful feelings, Marth leaves[N]
Grunia and lands at Macedonia, to rescue[AN]
Princess Minerva. After the War of[N]
Darkness, Macedonia was ruled by[AN]
Minerva, who removed the generals[N]
who had caused suffering to her[AN]
people, and renovated the army.[N]
However, the powerful General[AN]
Ryuke opposed Minerva's actions.[N]
He gathered the removed soldiers to[AN]
overthrow her in a coup. The unprepared[N]
Minerva was captured by Ryuke's[AN]
followers and Macedonia fell[N]
into the control of the rebels.[AN]
They then dispatched powerful dragon[N]
knights to sternly guard the[AN]
country's bordering forests.[AN]
