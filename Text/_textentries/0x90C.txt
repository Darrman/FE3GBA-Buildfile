General Lawrence recovered the children[N]
from Wendel, hoping to raise them in Grunia.[AN]
When the Emperor found out, he ordered[N]
him to hand over the children.[AN]
The general hid the children away[N] 
because he feared they would be killed.[AN]
Following that, he lost his power and[N]
then Commander Lang came.[AN]
In order to find the children,[N] 
Lang performed many atrocities.[AN]
Eventually we rebelled because we[N]
could no longer stand him.[AN]
But, everything's over.[N]
The people of this country will[AN]
all be killed by Lang![A][X]
