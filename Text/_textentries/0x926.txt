Who's there?[N]
Are you one of the pirates!?[AN]
[MR]
I am Sirius, a traveller...[AN]
[ML]
Is that so? I'm sorry.[N]
I overreacted a little.[AN]
Please accept my apologies.[AN]
[MR]
Those children...[AN]
[ML]
Something happened, so I'm[N]
taking care of them now.[AN]
You know them?[AN]
[MR]
No...[N]
But if you're carrying the children,[AN]
you won't be able to escape.[N]
I heard, from a village to the south,[AN]
that the Aritian army has come. Leave[N]
this place to me, and make your escape.[AN]
[ML]
What!?[AN]
The Aritian army...?[N]
So, Prince Marth...[AN]
I understand. Thanks.[N]
But, why are you helping me?[AN]
[MR]
I want to help those children.[N]
That's all...[AN]
[ML]
Really...?[N]
So you are Sirius...[AN]
If we escape safely, I hope we[N]
can meet again. I plan on killing[AN]
the ruler of Grunia, Commander Lang.[N]
So I can avenge a man named Lawrence...[AN]
You...[N]
If you could lend me your strength...[AN]
With you, I believe I will be able to succeed.[AN]
[MR]
Hmm...[N]
Perhaps it might be interesting...[AN]
However, to do that you must live.[N]
Well, get going![A]
