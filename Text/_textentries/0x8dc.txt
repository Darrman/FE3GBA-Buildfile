A year has passed since the War of[N]
Darkness. Thanks to the efforts of[N]
Prince Marth, the Kingdom of Aritia,[AN]
devastated by war, finally begins to[N]
stabilise. The knight Jeigan, who[N]
succeeded the ill Morodof, became the[AN] prince's tactician and helped him rule[N]
the country by his side. Afterwards,[N]
Princess Sheeda was welcomed to[AN]
Aritia, and her marriage with Prince[N]
Marth was announced. The citizens of[N]
Aritia were happy for the pair's[AN]
fortune and Sheeda was passionately[N]
welcomed to the country. However...[N]
Nearing the day of the wedding,[AN]
a letter suddenly comes from the[N]
imperial palace of Pales, containing[N]
an imperial order. "Dear Prince Marth[AN]
of Aritia. At the Kingdom of Grunia,[N]
occupied by Akaneia, a huge rebellion[N]
has broken out. I request for your[AN]
country to subdue Grunia. Your[N]
highness, please send Aritia's full[N]
army immediately, to quell Grunia's[AN]
rebellion. - Emperor Hardin"[N]
The Kingdom of Akaneia is the[N]
suzerain state to Aritia, and its[AN]
orders must be followed.[N]
The helpless Marth orders the knight[N]
Kain to protect his kingdom. And he[AN]
leaves, along with Jeigan and the[N]
others, on an expedition to Grunia...[A][X]
