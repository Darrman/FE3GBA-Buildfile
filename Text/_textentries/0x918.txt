Julian! Katua has finally brought[N]
the Aritian knights here. I will[AN]
go with them to rescue Princess Minerva.[N]
Please take Rena and hurry to safety.[AN]
[MR]
That isn't possible, Paola.[AN]
Miss Rena's gone missing...[N]
I'm not leaving just by myself.[AN]
[ML]
Huh, Rena's also... Princess[N]
Maria has also vanished. Why[AN]
are the sisters the only ones missing...?[AN]
[MR]
Anyway, I'm staying to search the village.[AN]
So, apologies, but I can't help[N]
you rescue your princess.[AN]
[ML]
Oh, it's alright.[AN]
We should be able to save Minerva[N]
by ourselves. But Julian, although[AN]
I know you're worried about Rena,[N]
don't push yourself.[AN]
[MR]
Ah... I'm sorry, Paola.[N]
Say "hi" to Prince Marth for me.[A][X]
