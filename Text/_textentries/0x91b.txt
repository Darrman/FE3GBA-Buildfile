Hey! That was uncalled for.[N]
Why do you always keep picking on me?[AN]
If you continue like this,[N]
you'll make Miss Rena sad.[AN]
[Left]
Oh, it's Julian. Are you[N]
still clinging onto Rena?[AN]
No way, I'm not handing my[N]
cute sister to a thief like you.[AN]
[Right]
Don't worry... Rena and I aren't[N]
that close. I just want to help[AN]
her, any little bit I can.[AN]
[Left]
Oh, I finally understand.[N]
You're really cool, Julian![AN]
[Right]
Well, I... uh... never expected[N]
to hear you say that...[AN]
Nevermind. If you're worried[N]
about Rena, come with us.[AN]
[Left]
Oh, really? Thanks. I was forced to[N]
join the rebels. I didn't really[AN]
want to fight. Well, "little brother",[N]
let's join forces to find my cute Rena![A][X]
