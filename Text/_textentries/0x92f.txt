Your highness, we've finally[N]
subdued Grunia. However, many[AN]
enemies are hiding inside the[N]
castle. So we must be careful.[AN]
[MR]
Hmm, I understand. Still... If we[N]
don't defeat Lang, the citizens[AN]
of this country cannot be saved.[AN]
[ML]
That's right. He must be defeated[N]
at all costs... Yet, we don't know[AN]
what dastardly plans he has prepared[N]
for us. So, if we're fighting inside,[AN]
we must be extremely careful![A][X]
