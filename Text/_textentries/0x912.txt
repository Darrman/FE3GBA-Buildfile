Your highness, we found an unexpected[n]
person held captive in the fortress.[A]
[Right]
Huh? ...Linda![n]
What are you doing here?[A]
[ML][Load][Linda]
Lord Marth! It's great to finally see you.[n]
In order to find you, I looked all over[AN]
for your news. Then the Macedonian soldiers[n]
captured me, and took me to this fortress...[A]
[Right]
I see. It's good to see that[n]
you're safe. Coming here by[AN]
yourself was a dangerous thing[n]
to do. But, why were you looking[AN]
for me? Shouldn't you be[n]
by Nina's side?[A]
[ML]
Princess Nina wanted me to[n]
give this to you.[A]
[Right]
? ...!![n]
That's the Fire Emblem![AN]
Isn't that the Akaneia royal[n]
family's treasured Emblem shield?![AN]
But why give it to me?[n]
Right now, shouldn't Akaneia be[AN]
prospering under Emperor Hardin's[n]
mighty rule? In this peaceful age,[AN]
why has Nina given the "Conqueror's[n]
Proof" to somebody like me...?[A]
[ML]
I don't know either.[n]
Nina didn't say anything and just[AN]
told me to give it to you...[n]
I don't know why, but her eyes[AN]
seemed so sad... As if she had[n]
been crying very hard...[AN]
[Right]
Nina!? Why... Linda, regardless,[n]
it's dangerous for you to go alone.[AN]
After this battle is over, we will[n]
return to Nina. Before that time[AN]
comes, you will travel together[n]
with us.[A]
[ML]
Understood, Lord Marth![A][X]
